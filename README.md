Assignments and projects in the course

Abstractâ€”This document specifies the approach, the process and implementation of Image Restoration. The program (written on MATLAB) allows the user to select  an original ground truth image, a degraded image and the kernel via which the image has been degraded. It offers four methods to restore the image, namely Full Inverse Filtering, Truncated Inverse Filtering, Weiner Filtering and Constrained Least Squares Method. Some of the methods also allow the user to choose a value of a parameter required to move ahead.
